My assignment description for Interpreting Data
This was an assignment based on improving an example of a handout of data that contains sea level rise. My task was to use the Army Corps tool to generate a chart of future SLR for a location of your choice in Florida. I chose Clearwater Beach. The next task was to download an image of the chart showing the sea level rise curves over a certain timespan, which I used the years 2025-2100. I used simple colors, readable text and graphics to make it easier on the eyes and readable by the target audience.
